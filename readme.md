# Stencil Table Component

This was created to learn more about Stencil.js

# Stencil

Stencil is a compiler for building fast web apps using Web Components.

Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frontend frameworks into a compile-time rather than run-time tool.  Stencil takes TypeScript, JSX, a tiny virtual DOM layer, efficient one-way data binding, an asynchronous rendering pipeline (similar to React Fiber), and lazy-loading out of the box, and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any browser supporting the Custom Elements v1 spec.

Stencil components are just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all.

## Installing

Clone this repo to a new directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mendacitees/stencil-learning-project.git 
```

and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To build the component for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```


## About This Component

I am new to web components and stencil.js.  This was my first attempt at making anything beyond the 
simplest "Hello World" component.

I was interested in learning about props in particular.  Specifically
using an object rather than just a boolean, number, or string.  I wanted to use either a
JSON object or an array.  I also made two examples: one where the object was added through Javascript
and another where it is stringified and passed as a property in an HTML tag.  Both seem to work.

This is not meant to duplicate the design system table in any way, as I wasn't looking at any of it's
requirements.  I just felt like this was a good starting point to accomplish what I was trying to learn.

### (Material Design Lite) [https://getmdl.io/customize/index.html]

Material Design Lite CSS was used to style the table.  It also adds the sort icons based on the class
for a given table cell.  Colors can be customized (here)[https://getmdl.io/customize/index.html]
